# Let us try STM

THe official package has a nice and clean vignette so that you can follow

<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stm/vignettes/stmVignette.pdf>

And it's github

<https://github.com/bstewart/stm>

## reading in documents

As the authors explained clearly:

> If you have your documents already converted to term-document matrices you can ingest them using readCorpus(). If you just have raw texts you will want to start with textProcessor().

I have taken a corpuse from quanteda called `gadarian`. It's from this article

> Gadarian, Shana Kushner, and Bethany Albertson. "Anxiety, immigration, and the search for information." Political Psychology 35.2 (2014): 133-164.

The experiment had those in the treatment condition write about what made them anxious about immigration.

-   The control condition just had subjects write about immigration.

We can compare how political party differences let people write their open-ended responese differently.

Key variables:

-   treatment: A numeric vector indicating treatment condition
    -   treated: read things such as "Gangs in the United States: How Illegal" or "Immigrants Complicate Law Enforcement: Why Unskilled Immigrants Hurt America"
    -   Control: real non-immigration related stories
-   pid_rep: from 0 to 6; 6=Strong Dem, 0=Strong Rep

```{r}
library("quanteda")
library("stm")
gadarian <- gadarian
data <- corpus(gadarian, text_field = 'open.ended.response')
summary(data)
```

First, use quanteda package to clean data and construct *document-term* matrix (since we already learned). `STM` package can also allow you to doi document-term matrix. You can follow the vignette to see how to do that in `STM`

```{r}
docvars(data)
docvars(data)$text <- as.character(data) # make text part of the metadata
docvars(data)$treated <- ifelse(gadarian$treatment == 1, "treated", "control")
docvars(data)$party = ifelse(data$pid_rep == 0.5, "neutral", ifelse(data$pid_rep < 0.5, "Rep", "Dem"))

#data_dfm <- dfm(data, stem = TRUE, remove = stopwords('english'),
#           remove_punct = TRUE) %>% dfm_trim(min_count = 2)
data_dfm <- dfm(tokens(data)) %>%
    dfm_remove(stopwords("en")) %>%
    dfm_wordstem() %>% dfm_trim(min_count = 2)

```

STM and quenteda takes different types of document-term matrix internally.

We transform the document-term matrix to STM's format

```{r}
out <- convert(data_dfm, to = 'stm')
```

## fiting topic model

First, I did not include covariates at all. So we are fitting a vanilla LDA model.

```{r}
gadarian_3_lda <- stm(documents = out$documents,
                 vocab = out$vocab,
                 K = 3)
labelTopics(gadarian_3_lda,  n = 20)
```

plot topics

```{r}
plot(gadarian_3_lda)
```

## topic prevalance

do topics vary by ideology?

```{r}
gadarian_3 <- stm(documents = out$documents,
                 vocab = out$vocab,
                 data = out$meta,
                prevalence = ~ pid_rep ,
                 K = 3, verbose = FALSE)

## explicity estimate effect of covariates on topic proportions
prep_3 <- estimateEffect(1:3 ~ pid_rep, gadarian_3,
                        meta = out$meta)
summary(prep_3)
```

```{r}
labelTopics(gadarian_3, n = 10)
```

```{r}
# plot differences between treatment/control
plot(prep_3, covariate = "pid_rep",  model = gadarian_3, method =  "continuous")
```

## plot differences between treatment/control, as well as by party identification, for one topic only

these is an interaction effect.

```{r}
## oly 
prep_topic1only <- estimateEffect(c(1) ~ treated * pid_rep, gadarian_3,
                        meta = out$meta)
summary(prep_topic1only)

plot(prep_topic1only, covariate = "pid_rep",  model = gadarian_3, method =  "continuous", moderator = "treated", moderator.value = "treated",  linecol = "blue",printlegend = F, ylim = c(0, .5))

plot(prep_topic1only, covariate = "pid_rep",  model = gadarian_3, method =  "continuous", moderator = "treated", moderator.value = "control",  linecol = "red",printlegend = F, add = T, ylim = c(0,.5))

legend(0.3, 0.2, c("Treated", "Control"), lwd = 2, col = c("blue", "red"))

```

## topical content differences

Note that I am modeling content differences

```{r}
gadarian_3 <- stm(documents = out$documents,
                 vocab = out$vocab,
                 data = out$meta,
                content = ~ treated ,
                 K = 3, verbose = FALSE)

## explicity estimate effect of covariates on topic proportions
prep_3 <- estimateEffect(1:3 ~ treated, gadarian_3,
                        meta = out$meta)
summary(prep_3)
```

Then plot topic differences, with respect to the third topic.

```{r}
plot(gadarian_3, type = "perspectives", topics = 3, width = 20, text.cex = 3)
```
