The skill set required for computer science jobs has evolved rapidly, creating challenges for those already in the workforce who need to adapt their skills quickly to meet industry demands. To stay ahead of the curve, it is essential to understand the hottest skills needed in the field. The article introduces a new method for analyzing job advertisements using social network analysis to identify the most critical skills required by employers in the market. In this research, to form the communication network of skills, first 5763 skills were collected from the LinkedIn social network, then the relationship between skills was collected and searched in 7777 computer science job advertisements, and finally, the balanced communication network of skills was formed. The study analyzes the formed communication network of skills in the computer science job market and identifies four distinct communities of skills: Generalists, Infrastructure and Security, Software Development, and Embedded Systems. The findings reveal that employers value both hard and soft skills, such as programming languages and teamwork. Communication skills were found to be the most important skill in the labor market. Additionally, certain skills were highlighted based on their centrality indices, including communication, English, SQL, Git, and business skills, among others. The study provides valuable insights into the current state of the computer science job market and can help guide individuals and organizations in making informed decisions about skills acquisition and hiring practices.\n",

      "        With an exponential increase in submissions to top-tier Computer Science (CS) conferences, more and more conferences have introduced a rebuttal stage to the conference peer review process. The rebuttal stage can be modeled as social interactions between authors and reviewers. A successful rebuttal often results in an increased review score after the rebuttal stage. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to determine the factors contributing to a successful rebuttal using over 3,000 papers and 13,000 reviews from ICLR2022, one of the most prestigious computer science conferences. First, we observe a significant difference in review scores before and after the rebuttal stage, which is crucial for paper acceptance. Furthermore, we investigate factors from the reviewer's perspective using signed social network analysis. A notable finding is the increase in balanced network structure after the rebuttal stage. Subsequently, we evaluate several quantifiable author rebuttal strategies and their effects on review scores. These strategies can help authors in improving their review scores. Finally, we used machine learning models to predict rebuttal success and validated the impact of potential factors analyzed in this paper. Our experiments demonstrate that the utilization of all features proposed in this study can aid in predicting the success of the rebuttal. In summary, this work presents a study on the impact factors of successful rebuttals from both reviewers' and authors' perspectives and lays the foundation for analyzing rebuttals with social network analysis.\n",

      "        Guidance on how to validate computational text-based measures of social science constructs is fragmented. While scholars generally acknowledge the importance of validating their text-based measures, they often lack common terminology and a unified framework to do so. This paper introduces ValiTex, a new validation framework designed to assist scholars in validly measuring social science constructs based on textual data. ValiTex prescribes researchers to demonstrate three types of validity evidence: substantive evidence (outlining the theoretical underpinning of the measure), structural evidence (examining the properties of the text model and its output), and external evidence (testing for how the measure relates to independent information). In addition to the framework, ValiTex offers valuable practical guidance through a checklist that is adaptable for different use cases. The checklist clearly defines and outlines specific validation steps while also offering a knowledgeable evaluation of the importance of each validation step to establish validity. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to a use case of detecting sexism from social media data.\n",

      "        Large Language Models (LLMs) have democratized synthetic data generation, which in turn has the potential to simplify and broaden a wide gamut of NLP tasks. Here, we tackle a pervasive problem in synthetic data generation: its generative distribution often differs from the distribution of real-world data researchers care about (in other words, it is unfaithful). In a case study on sarcasm detection, we study three strategies to increase the faithfulness of synthetic data: grounding, filtering, and taxonomy-based generation. We evaluate these strategies using the performance of classifiers trained with generated synthetic data on real-world data. While all three strategies improve the performance of classifiers, we find that grounding works best for the task at hand. As synthetic data generation plays an ever-increasing role in NLP research, we expect this work to be a stepping stone in improving its utility. We conclude this paper with some recommendations on how to generate high(er)-fidelity synthetic data for specific tasks.\n",

In this paper, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of two publicly accessible LLMs, ChatGPT and OpenAssistant, in the context of six Computational Social Science classification tasks, while also investigating the effects of various prompting strategies. Our experiments investigate the impact of prompt complexity, including the effect of incorporating label definitions into the prompt; use of synonyms for label names; and the influence of integrating past memories during foundation model training. The findings indicate that in a zero-shot setting, current LLMs are unable to match the performance of smaller, fine-tuned baseline transformer models (such as BERT-large). Additionally, we find that different prompting strategies can significantly affect classification accuracy, with variations in accuracy and F1 scores exceeding 10\\%.\n",

If zero-shot LLMs can also reliably classify and explain social phenomena like persuasiveness and political ideology, then LLMs could augment the Computational Social Science (CSS) pipeline in important ways. This work provides a road map for using LLMs as CSS tools. Towards this end, we contribute a set of prompting best practices and an extensive evaluation pipeline to measure the zero-shot performance of 13 language models on 25 representative English CSS benchmarks. On taxonomic labeling tasks (classification), LLMs fail to outperform the best fine-tuned models but still achieve fair levels of agreement with humans. On free-form coding tasks (generation), LLMs produce explanations that often exceed the quality of crowdworkers' gold references. We conclude that the performance of today's LLMs can augment the CSS research pipeline in two ways: (1) serving as zero-shot data annotators on human annotation teams, and (2) bootstrapping challenging creative generation tasks (e.g., explaining the underlying attributes of a text). In summary, LLMs are posed to meaningfully participate in} social science analysis in partnership with humans.\n",

      "        The video game industry plays an essential role in the entertainment sphere of our society. However, from Monopoly to Flight Simulators, serious games have also been appealing tools for learning a new language, conveying values, or training skills. Furthermore, the resurgence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data science in the last decade has created a unique opportunity since the amount of data collected through a game is immense, as is the amount of data needed to feed such AI algorithms. This paper aims to identify relevant research lines using Serious Games as a novel research tool, especially in Computational Social Sciences. To contextualize, we also conduct a (non-systematic) literature review of this field. We conclude that the synergy between games and data can foster the use of AI for good and open up new strategies to empower humanity and support social research with novel computational tools. We also discuss the challenges and new opportunities that arise from aspiring to such lofty goals.\n",

      "        Over the past decade, an explosion in the availability of education-related datasets has enabled new computational research in education. Much of this work has investigated digital traces of online learners in order to better understand and optimize their cognitive learning processes. Yet cognitive learning on digital platforms does not equal education. Instead, education is an inherently social, cultural, economic, and political process manifesting in physical spaces, and educational outcomes are influenced by many factors that precede and shape the cognitive learning process. Many of these are social factors like children's connections to schools (including teachers, counselors, and role models), parents and families, and the broader neighborhoods in which they live. In this article, we briefly discuss recent studies of learning through large-scale digital platforms, but largely focus on those exploring sociological aspects of education. We believe computational social scientists can creatively advance this emerging research frontier-and in doing so, help facilitate more equitable educational and life outcomes.\n",

In the latest years, statistical offices have made efforts to profit from harnessing the potential offered by these new sources of data, with promising results. But how difficult is this integration process? What are the challenges that statistical offices would likely face to profit from new data sources and analytical methods? This chapter will start by setting the scene of the current official statistics system, with a focus on its fundamental principles and dimensions relevant to the use of non-traditional data. It will then present some experiments and proofs of concept in the context of data innovation for official statistics, followed by a discussion on prospective challenges related to sustainable data access, new technical and methodological approaches and effective use of new sources of data.\n",

It aims to provide CSS scholars, as well as policymakers and other stakeholders who apply CSS methods, with the critical and constructive means needed to ensure that their practices are ethical, trustworthy, and responsible. It begins by providing a taxonomy of the ethical challenges faced by researchers in the field of CSS. These are challenges related to (1) the treatment of research subjects, (2) the impacts of CSS research on affected individuals and communities, (3) the quality of CSS research and to its epistemological status, (4) research integrity, and (5) research equity. Taking these challenges as a motivation for cultural transformation, it then argues for the end-to-end incorporation of habits of responsible research and innovation (RRI) into CSS practices, focusing on the role that contextual considerations, anticipatory reflection, impact assessment, public engagement, and justifiable and well-documented action should play across the research lifecycle. In proposing the inclusion of habits of RRI in CSS practices, the chapter lays out several practical steps needed for ethical, trustworthy, and responsible CSS research activities. These include stakeholder engagement processes, research impact assessments, data lifecycle documentation, bias self-assessments, and transparent research reporting protocols.\n",

These services, covering everything from mentoring to financial aid, are expected to be distributed in ways that prepare youth for life after care. However, surprisingly little is known about which youth receive which services. The present work makes use of the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD), a large-scale administrative dataset that tracks services allocated to youth that use CFCIP funds. Specifically, we conduct a forensic social science analysis of the NYTD data. To do so, we first use computational methods to help us uncover the most important factors associated with service receipt. Doing so helps us to identify three major factors-youth age, youth time in care, and the state in which a youth is in care-that are most heavily associated with service receive. We then conduct an analysis that links existing theory to these factors, expanding our understanding of how services are allocated and paving the way to future work to understand why such associations exist.\n",

This paper combines a socio-historical approach with an experimental reconstruction of programs to investigate the early automation of clique detection algorithms, which remains one of the unsolved NP-complete problems today. The research led by the archaeologist Jean-Claude Gardin from the 1950s on non-numerical information and graph analysis is retraced to demonstrate the early contributions of social sciences and humanities. The limited recognition and reception of Gardin's innovative computer application to the humanities are addressed through two factors, in addition to the effects of historiography and bibliographies on the recording, discoverability, and reuse of scientific productions: 1) funding policies, evidenced by the transfer of research effort on graph applications from temporary interdisciplinary spaces to disciplinary organizations related to the then-emerging field of computer science; and 2) the erratic careers of algorithms, in which efficiency, flaws, corrections, and authors' status, were determining factors.\n",

The study of CSS is data-driven and significantly benefits from the availability of online user-generated contents and social networks, which contain rich text and network data for investigation. However, these large-scale and multi-modal data also present researchers with a great challenge: how to represent data effectively to mine the meanings we want in CSS? To explore the answer, we give a thorough review of data representations in CSS for both text and network. Specifically, we summarize existing representations into two schemes, namely symbol-based and embedding-based representations, and introduce a series of typical methods for each scheme. Afterwards, we present the applications of the above representations based on the investigation of more than 400 research articles from 6 top venues involved with CSS. From the statistics of these applications, we unearth the strength of each kind of representations and discover the tendency that embedding-based representations are emerging and obtaining increasing attention over the last decade. Finally, we discuss several key challenges and open issues for future directions. This survey aims to provide a deeper understanding and more advisable applications of data representations for CSS researchers.\n",

We find that topical clustering and terminological enrichment provide for convenient exploration and quantification of the responses. This makes it possible to generate and test hypotheses and to compare textual and non-textual variables, and saves analyst effort. We encourage studies in social science to use text analysis, especially for exploratory open-ended studies. We discuss how replicability requirements are met by text analysis technology. We note that the most recent learning models are not designed with transparency in mind, and that research requires a model to be editable and its decisions to be explainable. The tools available today, such as the one used in the present study, are not built for processing interview texts. While many of the variables under consideration are quantifiable using lexical statistics, we find that some interesting and potentially valuable features are difficult or impossible to automatise reliably at present. We note that there are some potentially interesting applications for traditional natural language processing mechanisms such as named entity recognition and anaphora resolution in this application area. We conclude with a suggestion for language technologists to investigate the challenge of processing interview data comprehensively, especially the interplay between question and response, and we encourage social science researchers not to hesitate to use text analysis tools, especially for the exploratory phase of processing interview data.?\n",

      "        In the literature, smart grids are modeled as cyber-physical power systems without considering the computational social aspects. However, end-users are playing a key role in their operation and response to disturbances via demand response and distributed energy resources. Therefore, due to the critical role of active and passive end-users and the intermittency of renewable energy, smart grids must be planned and operated by considering the computational social aspects in addition to the technical aspects. The level of cooperation, flexibility, and other social features of the various stakeholders, including consumers, prosumers, and microgrids, affect the system efficiency, reliability, and resilience. In this paper, we design an artificial society simulating the interaction between power systems and the social communities that they serve via agent-based modeling inspired by Barsade's theory on the emotional spread. The simulation results show a decline in the consumers' and prosumers' satisfaction levels induced by a shortage of electricity. It also shows the effects of social diffusion via the Internet and mass media on the satisfaction level. In view of the importance of computational social science for power system applications and the limited number of publications devoted to it, we provide a list of research topics that need to be achieved to enhance the reliability and resilience of power systems' operation and planning.\n",

      "        Social science concerns issues on individuals, relationships, and the whole society. The complexity of research topics in social science makes it the amalgamation of multiple disciplines, such as economics, political science, and sociology, etc. For centuries, scientists have conducted many studies to understand the mechanisms of the society. However, due to the limitations of traditional research methods, there exist many critical social issues to be explored. To solve those issues, computational social science emerges due to the rapid advancements of computation technologies and the profound studies on social science. With the aids of the advanced research techniques, various kinds of data from diverse areas can be acquired nowadays, and they can help us look into social problems with a new eye. As a result, utilizing various data to reveal issues derived from computational social science area has attracted more and more attentions. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we present a survey on data-driven computational social science for the first time which primarily focuses on reviewing application domains involving human dynamics. The state-of-the-art research on human dynamics is reviewed from three aspects: individuals, relationships, and collectives. Specifically, the research methodologies used to address research challenges in aforementioned application domains are summarized. In addition, some important open challenges with respect to both emerging research topics and research methods are discussed.\n",

Computational thinking was one problem-solving skill that popular to implemented and studied in the current decade. This study was conducted to explore students' capability to be able solving of the problem based on the possibility use the computational thinking way. Participants in this study came from six international students that study in Taiwan and from two deferent sciences disciplines, engineering, and social science. A qualitative method was used to analyze data interviews, took example cases from the global issue that is Climate Change. The result founded that survive in a new environment was become evidence of their implementation of problem-solving skills. Problem-solving mindset both students of engineering and social science had discrepancy, those are how to use precise structure in the algorithm.\n",

On July 2, 2015, Jason Baumgartner published a dataset advertised to include ``every publicly available Reddit comment'' which was quickly shared on Bittorrent and the Internet Archive. This data quickly became the basis of many academic papers on topics including machine learning, social behavior, politics, breaking news, and hate speech. We have discovered substantial gaps and limitations in this dataset which may contribute to bias in the findings of that research. In this paper, we document the dataset, substantial missing observations in the dataset, and the risks to research validity from those gaps. In summary, we identify strong risks to research that considers user histories or network analysis, moderate risks to research that compares counts of participation, and lesser risk to machine learning research that avoids making representative claims about behavior and participation on Reddit.\n",

I propose a probabilistic model-based word embedding method which can recover interpretable embeddings, without big data. The key insight is to leverage mixed membership modeling, in which global representations are shared, but individual entities (i.e. dictionary words) are free to use these representations to uniquely differing degrees. I show how to train the model using a combination of state-of-the-art training techniques for word embeddings and topic models. The experimental results show an improvement in predictive language modeling of up to 63% in MRR over the skip-gram, and demonstrate that the representations are beneficial for supervised learning. I illustrate the interpretability of the models with computational social science case studies on State of the Union addresses and NIPS articles.\n",

      "        Labor market institutions are central for modern economies, and their polices can directly affect unemployment rates and economic growth. At the individual level, unemployment often has a detrimental impact on people's well-being and health. At the national level, high employment is one of the central goals of any economic policy, due to its close association with national prosperity. The main goal of this thesis is to highlight the need for frameworks that take into account the complex structure of labor market interactions. In particular, we explore the benefits of leveraging tools from computational social science, network science, and data-driven theories to measure the flow of opportunities and information in the context of the labor market. First, we investigate our key hypothesis, which is that opportunity/information flow through weak ties, and this is a key determinant of the length of unemployment. We then extend the idea of opportunity/information flow to clusters of other economic activities, where we expect the flow within clusters of related activities to be higher than within isolated activities. This captures the intuition that within related activities there are more \"capitals\" involved and that such activities require similar \"capabilities.\" Therefore, more extensive clusters of economic activities should generate greater growth through exploiting the greater flow of opportunities and information. We quantify the opportunity/information flow using a complexity measure of two economic activities (i.e. jobs and exports).\n",

Citizen Science can furnish ready made solutions with the active role of citizens. However, this framework is still far from being well stablished to become a standard tool for Computational Social Sciences research. We present our experience in bridging Computational Social Sciences with Citizen Science philosophy, which in our case has taken the form of what we call Pop-Up Experiments: Non-permanent, highly participatory collective experiments which blend features developed by Big Data methodologies and Behavioural Experiments protocols with ideals of Citizen Science. The main issues to take into account whenever planning experiments of this type are classified and discused grouped in three categories: public engagement, light infrastructure and knowledge return to citizens. We explain the solutions implemented providing practical examples grounded in our own experience in urban contexts (Barcelona, Spain). We hope that this work serves as guideline to groups willing to adopt and expand such \\emph{in-vivo} practices and opens the debate about the possibilities (but also the limitations) that the Citizen Science framework can offer to study social phenomena.\n",

      "        The emergence and popularization of online social networks suddenly made available a large amount of data from social organization, interaction and human behavior. All this information opens new perspectives and challenges to the study of social systems, being of interest to many fields. Although most online social networks are recent (less than fifteen years old), a vast amount of scientific papers was already published on this topic, dealing with a broad range of analytical methods and applications. This work describes how computational researches have approached this subject and the methods used to analyze such systems. Founded on a wide though non-exaustive review of the literature, a taxonomy is proposed to classify and describe different categories of research. Each research category is described and the main works, discoveries and perspectives are highlighted.\n",

Conversely, research in Big Data needs the volume and velocity of social media data for testing its scalability. Not only so, appropriate data processing and mining of acquired datasets involve complex issues in the variety, veracity, and variability of the data, after which visualisation must occur before we can see fruition in our efforts. This article presents topical, multimodal, and longitudinal social media datasets from the integration of various scalable open source technologies. The article details the process that led to the discovery of social information landscapes within the Twitter social network, highlighting the experience of dealing with social media datasets, using a funneling approach so that data becomes manageable. The article demonstrated the feasibility and value of using scalable open source technologies for acquiring massive, connected datasets for research in the social sciences.\n",

      "        In contrast to many other scientific disciplines, computer science considers conference publications. Conferences have the advantage of providing fast publication of papers and of bringing researchers together to present and discuss the paper with peers. Previous work on knowledge mapping focused on the map of all sciences or a particular domain based on ISI published JCR (Journal Citation Report). Although this data covers most of important journals, it lacks computer science conference and workshop proceedings. That results in an imprecise and incomplete analysis of the computer science knowledge. This paper presents an analysis on the computer science knowledge network constructed from all types of publications, aiming at providing a complete view of computer science research. Based on the combination of two important digital libraries (DBLP and CiteSeerX), we study the knowledge network created at journal/conference level using citation linkage, to identify the development of sub-disciplines. We investigate the collaborative and citation behavior of journals/conferences by analyzing the properties of their co-authorship and citation subgraphs. The paper draws several important conclusions. First, conferences constitute social structures that shape the computer science knowledge. Second, computer science is becoming more interdisciplinary. Third, experts are the key success factor for sustainability of journals/conferences.\n",
